### Office Checker

An Android application created to display if a BLE sensor is within range of a Raspberry Pi.  
Extended off of the [IoT Starter App](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-starter-for-android) created for the IBM Watson IoT Platform.  
Currently hardcoded to display "Eleni" as either "In Office" or "Not In Office".  
The display can be changed as desired.
